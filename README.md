### Background 

<pre> 

This is classic implementation of LZW  algorithm based on  Mark Nelson's book on
data  compression  from 1995.  It  uses  variable-width  dictionary codes up  to
16-bit. 

Original development was done in 1996-97. 

It  has been modified to be a single  executable performing both compression and
decompression, taking maximum bit length as argument for Compress2 function. 

The program has been tested  on Ubuntu 18.04 (with gcc and clang) and on Windows
10 (with Visual Studio 2019).

### Usage and Examples 

<pre> 

Running  make produces (1) executable `lzw10`; (2) static  library  `liblzw10.a`
with three  exported  functions  called Compress, Compress2  and Decompress (see
export.h) and  (3)  test  program `lzw_test`  statically  linked  with the above
library. 

Type `./lzw10` to see all command line options. 

Examples: 

`./lzw10 -p sample.txt sample.lzw` (pack sample.txt) 

`./lzw10 -u sample.lzw sample_copy.txt` (unpack sample.lzw) 

`./lzw10 -tv sample.txt` (test compression/decompression, verbose mode) 

`./lzw10 -large` (test synthetic data) 

`./lzw10 -b14 -large 10` (test synthetic data size 10 x 256 Kb, use max 14-bit) 

'./lzw10 -pv -b12 sample.txt sample.lzw`  (pack  sample.txt  using  codes  up to
12-bit width, verbose) 

</pre> 

### Notes and Limitations 

<pre> 

1. It supports input files up to 2GB in size. 

2. It is currently supported on little-endian machines only. 

</pre> 

### Possible improvements 

<pre> 

1. Add big endian support. 

2. Input  file size limit can be  fixed by replacing 4-byte  file size header in
compressed file with 48 or 64-bit values. 

3. BUFFLEN define (see common.h) which is shared between Compress and Decompress
calls can be  included in compressed output file header and then set dynamically
by Decompress. 

4. Add functions taking binary buffers as opposed to filenames. 

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The  code  can be relatively easily converted to support 17-bit  and even larger
maximum  width bit encoding. For this,  some  variables in Compress must be made
32-bit, and Decompress'  NOT_CODE value must be  more  than 16-bits, along  with
stack/suffix/prefix arrays. 

At the same time, as maximum code width grows, we hit  the "law  of  diminishing
returns" on data compression while also increasing  memory  requirements, so for
most practical purposes it's not really worth doing. 

Original versions  written in 1996 had maximum code width of 12-13 bits also  in
part due to memory constraints of DOS and early Windows; 15-bit width maximum on
modern  computers  gives more than adequate  compression for  LZW  while  taking
advantage of much larger available memory.
